AFTER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV DISSOLVED, IN 1991, THE KGB TOP SECRET INTELLIGENCE ADMINISTRATION, A LOT OF MATERIAL FROM THAT DEPARTMENT FOUND THEIR WAY ABROAD, IN PARTICULAR TO THE CIA. AS REPORTED BY THE AUTHORITATIVE MAGAZINE CANADIAN WEEKLY WORLD NEWS, U.S. INTELLIGENCE OBTAINED A 250-PAGE FILE ON THE ATTACK BY A UFO ON A MILITARY UNIT IN SIBERIA.

THE FILE CONTAINS NOT ONLYâ€¢MANY DOCUMENTARY PHOTOGRAPHS AND DRAWINGS, BUT ALSO TESTIMONIES BY ACTUAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE EVENTS. ONE OF THE CIA REPRESENTATIVES REFERRED TO THIS CASE AS "A HORRIFIC PICTURE OF REVENGE ON THE PART OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CREATURES, A PICTURE THAT MAKES ONE'S BLOOD 'FREEZE." 

ACCORDING TO THE KGB MATERIALS, A QUITE LOW-FLYING SPACESHIP IN THE SHAPE OF A SAUCER APPEARED ABOVE A MILITARY UNIT THAT WAS CONDUCTING ROUTINE TRAINING MANEUVERS, FOR UNKNOWN REASONS, SOMEBODY UNEXPECTEDLY LAUNCHED A SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE AND HIT THE UFO. IT FELL TO EARTH. NOT FAR AWAY, AND FIVE SHORT HUMANOIDS WITH "LARGE HEADS AND LARGE BLACK EYES" EMERGED FROM IT.

IT IS STATED IN THE TESTIMONIES BY THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO REMAINED ALIVE THAT, AFTER FREEING THEMSELVES FROM THE DEBRIS, THE ALIENS CAME CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEN "MERGED INTO A SINGLE OBJECT THAT ACQUIRED A SPHERICAL SHAPE." THAT OBJECT BEGAN TO BUZZ AND HISS-SHARPLY, AND THEN BECAME BRILLIANT WHITE. IN A FEW' SECONDS, THE SPHERES GREW MUCH BIGGER AND EXPLODED BY FLARING UP WITH AN EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHT. AT THAT VERY INSTANT, 23 SOLDIERS WHO HAD WATCHED THE PHENOMENON TURNED INTO... STONE POLES. ONLY TWO SOLDIERS WHO STOOD IN THE SHADE AND WERE LESS EXPOSED TO THE LUMINOUS EXPLOSION SURVIVED.

THE KGB REPORT GOES ON TO SAY THAT THE REMAINS OF THE UFO AND THE "PETRIFIED SOLDIERS" WERE TRANSFERRED TO A SECRET SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTION NEAR MOSCOW. SPECIALISTS ASSUME THAT A SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT IS STILL UNKNOWN TO EARTHLINGS INSTANTLY CHANGED THE STRUCTURE OF THE SOLDIERS' LIVING ORGANISMS, HAVING TRANSFORMED IT INTO A SUBSTANCE WHOSE MOLECULAR COMPOSITION IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF LIMESTONE.

A CIA REPRESENTATIVE STATED: "IF THE KGB FILE CORRESPONDS TO REALITY, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY MENACING CASE. THE ALIENS POSSESS SUCH WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT GO BEYOND ALL OUR ASSUMPTIONS. THEY CAN STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES IF ATTACKED. (ENDALL) es23003.o3 27 MAR 30/1529Z MAR BT #0317
