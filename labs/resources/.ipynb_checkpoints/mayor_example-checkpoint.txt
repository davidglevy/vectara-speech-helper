Our Council is committed to helping Brisbane residents tackle rising living costs. That’s why we’re investing $80 million this year in cost-of-living measures and supporting a growing range of free and affordable events.

An initiative I’m really excited about is our $2 Summer Dips. From 1 December, the entry cost to Council’s 22 fantastic pools will drop to just $2 for adults and children throughout summer.

There’s no limit. Residents can go as often as they like. For a family of 4, the cost of a trip to their local pool will fall from $20.15 to just $8.

Regardless of whether you’re keen to cool off with the kids or a regular lap swimmer, I hope all residents make the most of our $2 Summer Dips.
